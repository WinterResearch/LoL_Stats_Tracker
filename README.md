Tracks creep score, kills, and ultimate ability usage per game, with a historical average.

My thesis is you want to use your ult near as many times as you can in order to get out max value from strongest ability.

Ultimates are detected by a drop in mana = cost of ability, with a recent keyboard click of 'R', both verifying that your ultimate ability was used.

Currently hard coded to the mana cost of Lux's ult. Modify for your own character or wait for an upcoming update.

Creep score counter is batched in increments of 10.
